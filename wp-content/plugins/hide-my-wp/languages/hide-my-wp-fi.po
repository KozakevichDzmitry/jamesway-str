"PHP safe mode was one of the attempts to solve security problems of shared "

"providers, however, nowadays this is regarded as improper. A systematic "
"approach proves that it’s architecturally incorrect to try solving complex "
"security issues at the PHP level, rather than at the web server and OS "
"levels.<br /><br />Technically, safe mode is a PHP directive that restricts "
"the way some built-in PHP functions operate. The main problem here is "
"inconsistency. When turned on, PHP safe mode may prevent many legitimate PHP "
"functions from working correctly. At the same time there exists a variety of "

"restricted, so if a hacker has already got in – safe mode is useless."
